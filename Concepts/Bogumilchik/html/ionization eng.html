<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "ionization">Ionization</sc_element></b> - endothermic process of the formation of <sc_element sys_idtf  = "ion">ions</sc_element> from neutral <sc_element sys_idtf  = "atom">atoms</sc_element> or <sc_element sys_idtf  = "molecule">molecules</sc_element>.
The positively charged ion is produced when an <sc_element sys_idtf  = "electron">electron</sc_element> in the molecule gets enough energy to overcome the potential barrier equal to the ionization potential. The negatively charged ion, on the contrary, is formed by the capture of an additional electron atom to release energy.
