<b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "hydrogen_bond">Hydrogen bond</sc_element></b> - one of the types of intermolecular bonds. Mainly due to the electrostatic forces. For the occurrence of hydrogen bonding necessary that in the <sc_element sys_idtf  = "molecule">molecule</sc_element> had one or more <sc_element sys_idtf  = "elem_H">hydrogen</sc_element> <sc_element sys_idtf  = "atom">atoms</sc_element> bonded to a small but electronegative atoms, for example: <sc_element sys_idtf  = "elem_O">O</sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf  = "elem_N">N</sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf  = "elem_F">F</sc_element>. It is important that these are electronegative atoms lone electron pair. Hydrogen bonds characteristic for <sc_element sys_idtf  = "substance">substances</sc_element> such as <sc_element sys_idtf  = "water">water</sc_element> H2O, ammonia NH3, hydrogen fluoride HF.
